## a. Project Title: 

Matching restaurants and home-cooks with customers.

## b. Project Summary:

This project considers an application which matches customers to food-services. More
specifically, restaurants and home-cooks will be able to register to the application, post their
menus and receive orders from customers. Some of the features of the application are specifying
how expensive a vendor is, displaying ratings for a given vendor and rating a vendor.

Home-cooks are defined as individuals, who do not necessarily own a restaurant, but are willing
to sell food to customers, either because they wish to demonstrate their cooking skills, their
cultureâ€™s cuisine, or make extra profit out of this service. Moreover, this enables customers to
find food even when most restaurants are past their closing time.

## c. Description:

This application aims to expand food-service choices for customers wishing to receive food
services by extending food-service hours, offering a greater cuisine variety, and possibly a larger
area of service. Moreover, home-cooks wishing to test their cooking skills, showcase their dishes or use this app as another source of income are enabled to do that. Restaurants will also be included in the application as they are the main
food-service providers in most areas.

This ensures that local home-cooks are able to profit from part-time (or even full-time) cooking
while the customers will have more food options available. Restaurants can profit from this
application as well given that a part of the customer population will choose a restaurant as its
dining option.

## d. Usefulness:

This application is similar to applications such as Grubhub, or Doordash. What makes this
application novel is the inclusion of home-cooks. Home-cooks that register with the application
could provide food services to customers even when most restaurants are closed. Moreover,
including home-cooks offers a greater variety of type of foods, since home-cooks are able to
offer dishes produced according to their home/local culture that is not represented by a restaurant
in the area.

Another benefit is that customers located in an area with no restaurants nearby (e.g. suburban,
rural) could be potentially served by a local that is registered with the application and provides
such services. Restaurants will be included in this application since their operating hours could
be more stable than those of the home-cooks offering a more robust selection of food-services.

## e. Realness:

The data will concern details about various food-service providers, that is, restaurants and
home-cooks (e.g. providerId, location etc.) for a choice of areas/cities, customer data (e.g.
customerId, name etc.), order data (e.g. orderId etc). It will possibly include data about customer
experiences (e.g. review ratings). The data will either be synthetic (e.g. for home cooks, or
orders) or real from sites such as https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/.

## f. Functionality:

The functionalities of this application that concern CRUD and Search operations include
inserting new rows (e.g. new dishes) to the database, or allowing the user to search for an entity
(e.g. restaurant) and return the result to the interface. Moreover, they include updating records on
the database (e.g. update existing prices for dishes) and deleting rows from the database (e.g. a
dish is no longer being made, or a restaurant delete its account with the application). Also, they
will include advanced SQL queries such as Subqueries, and Aggregation and Group By (e.g.
when a customer asks for the average price of all the dishes of a vendor). Moreover,
functionalities will contain triggers (e.g. when a customer enters an invalid vendorId a trigger
will be activated) and procedures (e.g. when a user wants to calculate the average price of all the
items of a vendor).
