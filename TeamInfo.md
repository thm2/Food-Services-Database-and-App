## Project Summary

This project considers an application which matches customers to food-services. More specifically, restaurants and home-cooks will be able to register to the application, post their menus and receive orders from customers. Some of the features of the application are specifying how expensive a vendor is, displaying ratings for a given vendor and rating a vendor.

Home-cooks are defined as individuals, who do not necessarily own a restaurant, but are willing to sell food to customers, either because they wish to demonstrate their cooking skills, their cultureâ€™s cuisine, or make extra profit out of this service. Moreover, this enables customers to find food even when most restaurants are past their closing time.
