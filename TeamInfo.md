## Project Summary

This project considers an application which matches customers to food-services. More specifically, restaurants and home-cooks will be able to register to the application, post their menus and receive orders from customers. Some of the features of the application are specifying how expensive a vendor is, displaying ratings for a given vendor and rating a vendor.

Home-cooks are defined as individuals, who do not necessarily own a restaurant, but are willing to sell food to customers, either because they wish to demonstrate their cooking skills, their culture’s cuisine, or make extra profit out of this service. Moreover, this enables customers to find food even when most restaurants are past their closing time.
